# Generating-Keywords-for-Google-Ads-SMB
Generating Keywords for Google Ads by SMB
This project focuses on generating a set of keywords for a digital marketing agency working with a massive online furniture retailer. The objective is to create a prototype set of keywords for search campaigns, specifically targeting the sofas section. The client emphasizes the need for low-cost options and promotional keywords, targeting price-sensitive customers. The campaign requires a tightly targeted set of keywords set to exact and phrase match.

## Steps Taken in the Project

## 1 The Brief:

The project is initiated with a comprehensive brief from the client, emphasizing the need for budget-friendly keywords and the exclusion of luxury-related terms.

## 2 Word Combination with Products:
A list of relevant words is brainstormed and combined with the specified products to create meaningful search keywords.

## 3 Conversion to DataFrame:
The list of keyword combinations is converted into a DataFrame for easier manipulation and management of the final output.

## 4 Column Renaming:
The columns in the DataFrame are renamed appropriately to provide a clear understanding of the data, including Ad Group and Keyword names.

## 5 Addition of Campaign Column:
A new column, 'Campaign,' is added to the DataFrame, with the name 'SEM_Sofas' to describe the group of keywords and products.

## 6 Creation of Match Type Column:
The Match Type column is introduced, with the initial focus on exact match to align with the client's budget constraints.

## 7 Duplication into Phrase Match:
To enhance the visibility and control of the campaign, all keywords are duplicated into 'phrase' match, ensuring comprehensive coverage.

## 8 Save and Summarize:
The final step involves saving the campaign as a CSV file and creating a summary that provides a comprehensive overview of the campaign structure.

This project demonstrates how to effectively translate a client's brief into a well-structured and optimized set of keywords, aligned with specific advertising objectives and budget constraints.
